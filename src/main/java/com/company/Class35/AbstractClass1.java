// Rules of Abstract Class:
//Cannot create an object (instantiate) of an Abstract class, because it has no body in its method.
//Abstract class can have abstract methods as well as non-abstract methods.
//Child class is responsible to implement all abstract methods of abstract parent class. (it HAS to!). If it doesnâ€™t then child class has to be abstract.
//Abstract class can have instance variable.
//Abstract class can have constructor and this constructor will get called when we create an object of child class.
//Abstract class can have static variables and static methods as well.
//If at least one method inside the class is abstract we must make the class abstract.
